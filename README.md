# wp-jq-radio-slider

This is a simple plugin to convert radio buttons to sliders

## Contents

This Plugin includes (to be filled out later):

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `ChangeLog.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `wp-jq-radio-slider` subdirectory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* This plugin will convert Graity Forms radio buttons with the class "lw-slider" into jquery-ui-sliders. (Eventually no jQuery needed?)
* The aim of this plugin is to be very lightweight. (not there yet.)

## Installation

This plugin can be installed via FTP or upload through the WordPress dashboard.

1. You MUST have Gravity Forms installed
2. Create a form with Radio Inputs (or use the supplied test form.)
3. If you did not use the supplied test form, you must add the class "lw-slider" to each Radio Input you want to convert to a jquery-ui slider.
